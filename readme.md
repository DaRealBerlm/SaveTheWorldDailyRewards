# How to use
Log into chrome with your epic games account, and thats it. You only need to do this once. <br />
Run the exe, it will automatically get the data and run the api in headless mode.

This may seem obvious, but: YOU NEED TO BUY THE GAME!

# Not working?
This most likely happens because of an outdated webdriver. <br />
Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/, and download version that your broswer is currently on (can check on chrome://version/). <br />
Download the corresponding variable from here, then make sure to update your chromedriver in your PATH variable.
